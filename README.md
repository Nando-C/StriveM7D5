<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<img src="public/assets/nandotify-screenshot.png" alt="album">

A Spotify clone project to put in practise our Front-End skills, as part of the Full Stack Master Camp at Strive School. This was my first real world project, started during the first modules of the program, but then I decided to create this new repo and built it again from scratch, as I have a much better understanding of the technologies and code practises.

All the information is retrieved from the dezzer API.

### Built With

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)

### Redux Store

Part of the objectives for this project was to consolidate my knowledge using Redux and Redux Tool Kit. So I created three Redux slices to handle the state on this project.

- Home

- Artist

- Album

- A full picture of the state

I did not see the point of including the search page information in the redux store, so this is managed on the component's local state.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## App Use

The work flow of this application is similar to the real spotify. However, not all features have been implemented, yet.

### Home

- Home is the landing page, you will start from here, where you have some recomendations of the day.
- By clicking on the album cover or the song title, you will be directed to the album page.

- Otherwise, clicking on the artist name will take you to the artist page.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Search

- Go to the search page by clicking on the search option on the navigation bar.
- Here you have a pre-selection of "trending" tracks.
- To perform a search, start typing the name of your favorite song or artist on the search box.

- Once you have found what you are looking for, access the content in the same way as in the home page.
